## Analytics

Since [v1.37.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.37.0) Flipt includes functionality for reporting analytical data to a configurable storage engine.

Currently, Flipt has support for reporting data into:
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)

The data that gets reported into the storage backends are currently:
- Flag Evaluation Count

All of these analytics are viewable on the UI, and users can look back up to 12 hours of data for each metric.

The image above shows the past 30 minutes of evaluation(s) count for the flag `flag1`.

## Considerations

It is important to note that you are **required** to create a database called `flipt_analytics` so that Flipt will have a logically isolated instance to report data into without interrupting any of your possible existing data in other databases.

The reason for this is not just a separation of concerns on a general level, but for possible data migrations and other related things via data on a technical level.
