## Analytics

Since [v1.37.0](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/releases/tag/v1.37.0) Flipt includes functionality for reporting analytical data to a configurable storage engine.

Currently, Flipt has support for reporting data into:

- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)

The data that gets reported into the storage backends are currently:

- Flag Evaluation Count

These analytics are viewable on the UI, and users can look back up to 24 hours of data for each metric.

The image above shows the past 30 minutes of evaluation(s) count for the flag `flag1`.

## Considerations

### Database

It's important to note that we do \*recommend\*\* for you to a separate database for analytics produced by Flipt so that the data can logically isolated from the rest of your Clickhouse data.

The reason for this isn't just a separation of concerns on a general level, but for possible data migrations and other related things via data on a technical level if changes do arise on our end.

### Origin of Analytics

Analytics are only produced currently as they pass through the server. This means you will receive data in your analytics database if your use either the [server sdks](/integration/server/rest) or the various [grpc sdks](/integration/server/grpc).

For client-side evaluation no metrics will be sent into clickhouse, but we're working on a feature to get it supported.
